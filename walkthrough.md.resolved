# Walkthrough: Cuvatex Landing Page Implementation

I have successfully initialized and implemented the Cuvatex landing page project using Next.js, TypeScript, and Vanilla CSS. The project features a premium engineering-focused design, full multilingual support (EN, FR, AR), and RTL compatibility.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Multilingual & RTL Support
- Integrated `next-intl` for SEO-friendly localized routing.
- Implemented a [LocaleSwitcher](file:///d:/Cuvatex%20landing%20page/src/components/layout/LocaleSwitcher.tsx#8-58) in the responsive Navbar.
- Added RTL (Right-to-Left) support for the Arabic locale, ensuring layout and typography adjust correctly.

### 2. Premium Design System
- Defined a cohesive design system in [globals.css](file:///d:/Cuvatex%20landing%20page/src/app/globals.css) using CSS variables for colors, typography, and spacing.
- Used **Poppins** as the primary font to align with the design specification.
- Implemented custom UI components like a reusable [Button](file:///d:/Cuvatex%20landing%20page/src/components/ui/Button.tsx#11-75) with multiple variants.

### 3. Home Page Sections
- **Hero**: High-impact heading with an animated background.
- **Services Preview**: Card-based overview of core offerings (Web, Mobile, MVP).
- **Why Cuvatex**: Value-driven section emphasizing engineering excellence and partnership.
- **Projects Snapshot**: Visual grid of selected projects with hover effects.
- **Tech Stack**: Modern grid showing the agency's technical expertise.
- **CTA**: Prominent section for lead generation.

### 4. Special Pages
- **MVP for Startups**: Conversion-focused page with timelines and deliverables.
- **Process**: Timeline-based walkthrough of the agency's development workflow.
- **About**: Brand story and vision section.
- **FAQ**: Interactive accordion for common client inquiries.
- **Contact**: Focused section with direct WhatsApp integration.

## Technical Details

- **Framework**: Next.js (App Router)
- **Styling**: Vanilla CSS (using `styled-jsx` for component-scoped styles).
- **Animations**: `framer-motion` used for subtle scroll reveals and micro-interactions.
- **Icons**: `lucide-react`.
